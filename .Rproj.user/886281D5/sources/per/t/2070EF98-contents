# 1 Q&A from the previous session

## 1.1 Data frame header

When we read a CSV file with `read.csv`, there is an argument `header` deciding whether it reads the first row as the column names of the variables.

Recall that last time, we generated a random data frame of columns named "id" and "score" first.

```{r}
data <- data.frame(
  id = 1:3,
  score = sample(5:10, 3, replace = TRUE) # sample(list, n) allows you to sample number n values from list
)
data
```

Now, we write `data` into a CSV file

```{r}
# Write the data frame to a CSV file
write.csv(data, "sample_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

If we read with `header=TRUE` (default in this case), "id" and "score" are parsed as column names instead of variable values

```{r}
data_read_header <- read.csv("sample_data.csv", header = TRUE)
data_read_header
```

However, if we read with `header=FALSE`, then "id" and "score" are regarded as values

```{r}
data_read_noheader <- read.csv("sample_data.csv", header = FALSE)
data_read_noheader
```

In this case, you would run into problems if you simply take the first column of `data_read`:

```{r}
data_read_noheader[,1]
```

You also run into problems if you are getting a column by its name:

```{r}
data_read_header$id
```

```{r}
data_read_noheader$id
```

::: callout-note
## Note

`header` is defaulted to `TRUE` if and only if the first row contains one fewer field than the number of columns. For further details, use `?read.csv` to check the full documentation.

## 1.2 R script vs Console

The R Console is an interactive platform for immediate execution of individual commands, ideal for exploratory data analysis and quick tests.

In contrast, R Scripts are non-interactive files where code can be written, saved, and executed in a structured and reproducible manner, suitable for complex and longer projects.

## 1.3 Installing and loading packages

When you find a useful R package that isn't already installed on your system, you use `install.packages()` to download and install it. This is typically a one-time process for each package. For example, to install the `ggplot2` package, you would use:

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false

install.packages("ggplot2")
```

Every time you start a new R session and want to use a previously installed package, you need to load it using the `library()` function. This needs to be done at the beginning of your scripts to ensure that all functions from the package are available. For example:

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
```

This command does not install the package again, but simply makes its functionality available in your current session.

## 1.4 Converting between strings and mumbers

To convert a string that represents a number into a numeric format, you can use the `as.numeric()` function. For example:

```{r}
numbers_as_strings <- c("1", "2", "3")
numbers <- as.numeric(numbers_as_strings)
```

Conversely, if you need to convert numbers to strings, perhaps for output formatting, use the `as.character()` function:

```{r}
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3)
numbers_as_strings <- as.character(numbers)
```

# 2 Functions in R

In R, a function is defined using the `function` keyword. The basic syntax is:

```{r}
myFunction <- function(arg1, arg2) {
  # Function body
  result <- arg1 + arg2
  return(result)
}
```

This creates a function `myFunction` that takes two arguments `arg1` and `arg2`, adds them together, and returns the result.

Once a function is defined, it can be called with specific values for its arguments.

```{r}
# Calling the function
result <- myFunction(5, 3)
print(result) # Outputs 5+3
```

The `apply` family of functions in R is used to apply a function over the margins of an array or matrix, and it's particularly useful for data frames. For example, `apply` can be used to apply a function to each column or row of a data frame.

```{r}
# Example data frame
df <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = 4:6)
df
```

```{r}
# Define a simple function to calculate the mean
meanFunction <- function(x) {
  return(mean(x))
}

# Apply meanFunction to each column of df to get the mean of each column
apply(df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = meanFunction) # MARGIN = 1 indicates rows (try it!)
```

This will calculate the mean of each column in the data frame `df`.

## 3.1 Random numbers and data frame

### 3.1.1 Generating Random Numbers and Names

\(i\) Generate two vectors $(v_1,v_2)$ of 30 random integers each, where the elements in $v_1$ are uniformly drawn from $\{80,81,\dots,100\}$, and the elements in $v_2$ are uniformly drawn from $\{60,61,\dots, 90 \}$, with replacement.

```{r include=FALSE}
v1<-sample(80:100, 30, replace = TRUE)
v2<-sample(60:90, 30, replace = TRUE)
```

\(ii\) Generate a vector of 30 random names using the `randomNames()` function. Remember to install the `randomNames` package and load it!

```{r include=FALSE}
install.packages("randomNames")
library("randomNames")
```

::: callout-tip
## Hint

`set.seed()` allows the code to be reproducible by setting a specific seed value. When a seed is set, the sequence generated remains deterministic.
:::

```{r include=FALSE}
set.seed(21012024)
names<-randomNames(30)
```

### 3.1.2 Create a data frame

We aim to record the names, assignment marks, and exam marks of 30 students from course 1 in a table. Using the functions above, first generate these items randomly, then combine them into a data frame with three columns: "names", "assignment", and "exam".

```{r include=FALSE}
course1<- data.frame(
  names=randomNames(30),
  assignment=sample(80:100,30,replace = TRUE), 
  exam=sample(60:90,30,replace = TRUE))
```

### 3.1.3 Deal with data frame

\(i\) First, calculate the final marks for this course using the formula $$\text{Final mark} = 0.2\times \text{Assignment} + 0.8\times \text{Exam}$$ and add this information to a new column named `finalMark`.

```{r include=FALSE}
course1$finalMark<-(0.2*course1$assignment+0.8*course1$exam)
```

\(ii\) Can you find the student with the highest `finalMark`?

::: callout-tip
## Hint

1.  You may consider sorting your data frame in descending order by the values of `finalMarks` - look up the different between `sort` and `order`!
2.  Alternatively, you can use the `arrange` function in the [**`dplyr`**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) package for this task (optional).
:::

```{r include=FALSE}
course1[order(course1$finalMark,decreasing = TRUE),][1,]
```

```{r include=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
library("dplyr")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
course1 %>% arrange(desc(finalMark)) %>% head()
```

\(iii\) Next, calculate the means of `assignment`, `exam`, and `finalMarks`, respectively.

```{r include=FALSE}
round(mean(course1$Assignment))
round(mean(course1$Exam))
round(mean(course1$FinalMark))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
round(apply(X = course1[,2:4], MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
course1 %>%
  summarize(across(c(2,3,4),mean)) %>% round()
```

\(iv\) Then, randomly pick 10 students and set then to have chosen course 2. The other students have not chosen this course. Please add a column `course2` to indicate their choice (0 for yes,1 for no).

```{r include=FALSE}
random_numbers<-sample(1:30,10,replace = FALSE)
course1$course2<- 0
course1[c(random_numbers),]$course2<-1
```

\(v\) Finally, find the students with marks above 85 and who haven't chosen course 2 by extracting values from the `names` column. You can also use the `apply()` function for this purpose. Verify if these two methods give the same results.

```{r include=FALSE}
course1[course1$finalMark>85 & course1$course2==0,]$names
```

```{r include=FALSE}
check<-function(x){
  value <- x[1]>85 & x[2]==0
  return(value)
}

filter<-apply(X = course1[,c(4,5)], 1, FUN = check)
course1[filter,]$names
```

## 3.2 Define a function

Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by recurrent relations:

$F_0=0,\ F_1=1,\ F_n=F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$.

Define a function to produce the nth Fibonacci number with or without a loop.

```{r include=FALSE}
fb<-function(n){
  f<-c(0,1)
  if (n>1){
  for (i in 2:n){
    f[i+1] <- f[i] + f[i-1]
  }}
  return(f[n+1])
}

```

```{r include=FALSE}
fb<-function(n){
  if(n==0){
    return(0)
  }
  if(n==1){
    return(1)
  }
  fb(n-1)+fb(n-2)
}

```

## 3.3 Uniform distribution and histogram

Simulate 1000 samples from a uniform distribution $X\sim U[0,1]$ and create a histogram of the generated sequence. Overlay the histogram on the probability density function - does the histogram reflect the density well?

::: callout-tip
## Hint

1.  You can look up `dunif()`, which defines the probability density function of a uniform distribution.
2.  To plot the histogram, you can simply use the `hist` function - alternatively, you can try the `ggplot2` package.
:::

```{r include=FALSE}
# generate the samples
num_sample <- 1000 # you can try different values of num_sample
sample <- runif(n=num_sample,min=0,max=1)
```

```{r include=FALSE}

# get 100 evenly spaced values between -0.25 and 1.25 to plot the probability density function of the uniform distribution
x <- seq(-0.25, 1.25, length.out=100)

#plotting the histogram
title <- sprintf("Histogram of %d simulations from X~U(%d,%d)", num_sample, 0, 1)
hist(sample, main = title, xlim = c(-0.5, 1.5), xlab = "x", prob = TRUE,col="lightblue", ylab="f (x)")
lines(x, dunif(x,min=0,max=1), col = "red", lwd = 2)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Load ggplot2 library
library(ggplot2)

# Create a data frame for the samples
df <- data.frame(sample)

# Create the histogram and overlay the probability density function
ggplot(df, aes(x = sample)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), binwidth = 0.08, fill = "lightblue", colour = "black") + 
  # here (y = ..density..) means that we map the y-axis aesthetic to the density of the data,   rather than the count, which is the default.
  stat_function(fun = dunif, xlim = c(-0.25, 1.25), args = list(min = 0, max = 1), colour = "red", linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = sprintf("Histogram of %d simulations from X~U(%d,%d)", num_sample, 0, 1))
```

# 4\* Simulation Game: Coin Tossing Problem

::: callout-note
## Note

This is a more complicated simulation game and is not compulsory - try it if you are interested!
:::

## Problem Statement

A and B are tossing a fair coin. A wins if HHH appears first; B wins if HTH appears first. Who is more likely to win?

## Simulation Code

We can write some codes to simulate the game

```{r}
simulate_coin_toss <- function(sequence_a, sequence_b, num_simulations = 10000) {
  wins_a <- 0
  wins_b <- 0

  # play the game num_simulations times
  for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
    
    # keep tossing until there is a winner
    coin_sequence <- ""
    while (!grepl(sequence_a, coin_sequence) && !grepl(sequence_b, coin_sequence)) {
      coin_sequence <- paste0(coin_sequence, sample(c("H", "T"), 1, replace = TRUE))
    }
    
    # record the winner
    if (grepl(sequence_a, coin_sequence)) {
      wins_a <- wins_a + 1
    } else {
      wins_b <- wins_b + 1
    }
  }

  # use the number of wins to estimate the winning probability
  prob_a_wins <- wins_a / num_simulations
  prob_b_wins <- wins_b / num_simulations

  return(c(prob_a_wins, prob_b_wins))
}

# Call the function
simulate_coin_toss("HHH", "HTH")
```

::: callout-important
## Your turn

1.  Can you write some codes to estimate the expected number of tosses needed until a certain player gets a win?
2.  Can you prove your winning probabilities algebraically?
:::

```{r include=FALSE}
# Function to calculate expected number of tosses
expected_tosses <- function(sequence, num_simulations = 10000) {
  toss_counts <- numeric(num_simulations)

  for (i in 1:num_simulations) {
    coin_sequence <- ""
    toss_count <- 0

    while (!grepl(sequence, coin_sequence)) {
      coin_sequence <- paste0(coin_sequence, sample(c("H", "T"), 1, replace = TRUE))
      toss_count <- toss_count + 1
    }

    toss_counts[i] <- toss_count
  }

  mean(toss_counts)
}

# Calculate for sequences "HHH" and "HHT"
expected_tosses("HHH")
expected_tosses("HTT")
```
