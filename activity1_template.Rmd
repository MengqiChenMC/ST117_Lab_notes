# **Task 1: Visualising a Small Dataset**

## 1.1 Find a Small Dataset 

<This can be from an online source or a dataset you create manually. Describe the dataset briefly.>

## 1.2  Load the Dataset

<Use R to load your dataset into a data frame. Show the code you used. You may use functions such as `head()` or `glimpse`(from `dplyr`) to display the data frame>

```{r load-small-dataset}
# Your R code to load (and display) the dataset 
```

## 1.3  Visualisation 

<Create a visualisation of the dataset. Consider the type of data and what you wish to convey.>

```{r visualise-small-dataset}
# Your R code for the visualisation
```

## 1.4  Explanation

<Explain why you chose the type of plot, what it aims to show, and what insights it provides about the dataset's context.>

# **Task 2: Visualising a Large Dataset**

## 2.1 Find a Large Dataset

<Look for a large dataset available online. Describe the dataset and its source.>

## 2.2  Load the Dataset

<Use R to load your dataset into a data frame. Show the code you used. You may use functions such as `head()` or `glimpse`(from `dplyr`) to display the data frame>
```{r load-large-dataset}
# Your R code to load (and display) the dataset 
```

## 2.3  Visualisation

<Create a visualisation that highlights key aspects of the dataset.>

```{r visualise-large-dataset}
# Your R code for the visualisation
```

## 2.4  Explanation

<Discuss your choice of visualisation, its relevance, and the insights it offers about the dataset.>

```{r explanation-large-dataset}
# Your written explanation
```

# **Conclusion (optional)**

<Reflect on the process of visualising these two datasets. Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. Consider how the size of a dataset can influence the approach to data visualisation.>

# **References (optional)**

<Include any references to data sources or other materials you used in this activity.>
